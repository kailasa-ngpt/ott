# AI Chat Feature Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation (Phase 1)

âœ… **Basic AI Service Setup**
- Created FastAPI application with `/api/chat` endpoint
- Implemented OpenAI API integration with GPT-4o mini
- Added support for optional document_id parameter
- Set up basic RAG integration
- Created Dockerfile and added service to docker-compose.yml
- Added test client

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Set up the RAG API endpoint with proper configuration
- [ ] Create .env file with actual API keys
- [ ] Test AI service in isolation with test_client.py
- [ ] Integrate AI service with main backend
- [ ] Add authentication to the AI service

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Implement conversation history storage
- [ ] Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Optimize RAG integration for better performance
- [ ] Add support for streaming responses

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration
- [ ] Create chat UI component
- [ ] Implement real-time messaging with WebSockets
- [ ] Add loading indicators and error handling
- [ ] Implement user feedback mechanism for AI responses

## Integration with Main Application

The AI service is designed to be integrated with the main backend. The main backend should:

1. Expose an endpoint that frontend can call to chat about videos
2. When receiving a chat request, forward it to the AI service with the appropriate document_id
3. Return the AI response to the frontend

### API Flow:
```
Frontend -> Main Backend -> AI Service -> RAG Service
                                       -> OpenAI API
```

## Monitoring and Improvements

After initial deployment, we should:

1. Monitor API performance and costs
2. Collect user feedback on answer quality
3. Fine-tune prompts based on feedback
4. Consider implementing a caching layer for common questions
